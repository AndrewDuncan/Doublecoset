Today I ran the program on the example in our paper (as far as Mod 3).

I found one thing that had to be changed.
Namely, when making X_1 and X_2 components, right at the start,
if there is a component that turns out to have only edges of type Z,
then it has to be removed. I added this to the appropriate part of the
algorithm. (In the more or less  certain knowledge that in fact the
algorithm will have to be changed a bit and then this won't be
necessary.)
