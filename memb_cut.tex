 Now assume that $\D_{(0)}=\G_K$ is input to the Loop. 
 As $\G_K$ has at
most $M$ vertices, it has at most $M$  components of type $X_1$ and $X_2$. 
The Loop  is repeated


 only if $\D_{(n+1)}$ has fewer  $X_1$ and $X_2$ components
than $\D_{(n)}$: so there can be at most $M$ iterations of the loop.

The number of vertices of $\D_{(n+1)}$ is
\[\textrm{some function of the number of vertices of } \D_{(n)}\]
and the number of edges of     $\D_{(n+1)}$ is ...

Hence the $n$th iteration of the loop takes time ... .

Therefore the total time taken to produce $\Psi$ is ...
